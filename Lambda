An anonymous function

starting with the below function to demonstrate how lambda can do the same thing

def func(x):
  return (x+5)

funcName = lambda x: x+5

syntax = lambda (parameter): (function you would like to output)

x is the parameter that you are going to feed your function

more or less you are using it to create a quick function in the moment to use super quick
